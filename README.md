### RecipeManager

This is a small chrome extension I wrote to learn a little bit about JavaScript, Chrome Extensions and the Gemini API. 
The goal of the project is for a LLM to help me organize my recipe folder. In particular, I want to add 
"tags" to my recipes, so that I can search for them more easily. A tag could be something like 
"VEGETARIAN" or "CHICKEN".
